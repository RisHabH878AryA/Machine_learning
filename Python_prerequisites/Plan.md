# Python Revision Exercises for ML Prep

## 1. Lists & Comprehensions

**Mini exercises:**

* P1: Filter all even numbers from a list of 1–100.
* P2: Square all numbers in a list without a loop (use comprehension).
* P3: Flatten a list of lists in one line.

**Twist:**

* Do the same but using `map` + `lambda` — compare clarity & speed.

## 2. Dictionaries & Comprehensions

**Mini exercises:**

* P1: Count occurrences of each word in a sentence (dict comprehension).
* P2: Swap keys and values of a dictionary.
* P3: Create a dict of numbers 1–10 and their squares.

**Twist:**

* Handle duplicates while swapping (challenge for edge cases).

---

## 3. Sets

**Mini exercises:**

* P1: Find common elements between two lists.
* P2: Remove duplicates from a list while preserving order (slightly tricky!).
* P3: Use sets to check if a list has any duplicates efficiently.

---

## 4. Functions & Lambdas

**Mini exercises:**

* P1: Write a function that takes any number of arguments and returns the sum.
* P2: Write a lambda that checks if a string is palindrome.
* P3: Nested functions: Create a function that returns another function which multiplies by `n`.

## 5. File I/O

**Mini exercises:**

* P1: Read a CSV, count number of rows, columns, missing values.
* P2: Write a JSON file from a dict and read it back.
* P3: Read a text file, count frequency of each word.

---

## 6. Exception Handling

**Mini exercises:**

* P1: Open a file that doesn’t exist and catch the exception gracefully.
* P2: Handle division by zero in a function that takes two numbers.
* P3: Try converting strings to integers, catch `ValueError` if conversion fails.

### **Pro Tip:**

Make a **“revision notebook”** with 5–10 problems per topic. Every day, pick 2–3 topics and implement. Don’t just copy solutions — **tweak them, break them, handle edge cases**. That’s how concepts **actually stick**.
